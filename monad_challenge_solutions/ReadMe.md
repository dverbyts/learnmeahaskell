These solution files represent my work in January 2016 to solve the [Monad Challenges](http://mightybyte.github.io/monad-challenges/) exercises created and hosted by MightyByte (Doug Beardsley).

As explained in the challenges, you must install a customized Prelude called MCPrelude that overwrites many standard Haskell functions to disable you from taking shortcuts.

To use my solutions, you'll need to get a copy of the monad challenges code and follow the setup and install instructions that it gives.

I strongly encourage you to do the exercises yourself, and only refer to solutions if you've really exhausted all options. And even then, only peek at the minimal part of the solution code you need to get going again.
